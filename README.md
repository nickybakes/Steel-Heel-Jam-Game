# Steel Heel Jam
A top-down multiplayer brawling game. I designed and developed the core gameplay and combat and I did the art as well. \

- Steel Heel Jam is heavily inspired by professional wrestling entertainment.
- Your goal is to stay inside the shrinking ring and knock your opponents out of the ring.
- Your health and stamina are combined into one stat: your Audience Approval. If your Approval reaches 0 while outside the ring, you are eliminated.
- You have a dedicated button for Flexing. Getting into fights and flexing in the big spotlight will fill your Spotlight meter.
- Once filled, you're given a buff for the rest of the match. Get enough buffs and you'll ignite the powerful Heel Fire and devastate your opponents.
- You can pick up and use weapons thrown in by the audience.

I designed and developed the game's rules/logic, player movement, combat and weapon interactions, computer controlled bots, animation systems, and scalable multiplayer logic. My goal was to make a hectic game that anyone can pick up and master. We did lots of playtesting to fine tune everything to just the right level of chaos and competitiveness. I also created all the art in the game, and wrote many of the voice lines for the announcer (voiced by Kieran Newell).

Steel Heel Jam was created in 3 months by Nick Baker, Brian Kiss, Joshua Quinones, and Sam Lambermont.
